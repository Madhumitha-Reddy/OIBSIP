#Iris flower classification

#The aim is to classify the iris flowers among three species(setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals length and width.
#The iris dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to type of iris plant.
#The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classification for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization

#Unemployment analysis with python
