#Iris flower classification

#The aim is to classify the iris flowers among three species(setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals length and width.
#The iris dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to type of iris plant.
#The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classification for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization

#Unemployment analysis with python 

#Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
#who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate

#Car price prediction with machine learning
#The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.

#Email spam detection with machine learning

#Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.


#In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

#sales prediction using python

#Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.


#Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product.
